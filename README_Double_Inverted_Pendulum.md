# 🎯 Double Inverted Pendulum - Digital Control & Simulation

This repository showcases the complete simulation, control design, and implementation of a **double inverted pendulum** using digital control strategies. The system is analyzed and controlled using state-space techniques in MATLAB, targeting stabilization of an inherently unstable, underactuated system.
